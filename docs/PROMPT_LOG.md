## Step 1 — Plumbing

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 01 — Framing the assignment

- 🧑 **Asked:** Build gowallet (Go REST API + SQLite) in three stages — plumbing, dev system,
  then design & build. I'm new to Go; keep explanations brief but proper. Set up Go, SQLite, and
  a GitHub repo, and record every prompt/answer as a timeline. Tone: relaxed, visual, descriptive.
- 🤖 **Did:** Ran a deep-interrogation pass instead of jumping to code. Read the spec
  (`docs/specifications.pdf` — an OfferZen/Sanlam SFTX Senior Engineer take-home: loyalty points
  wallet, ~4h, README + SOLUTION.md + Loom demo). Probed the machine: only `git` present — no Go,
  `gh`, C compiler, or `sqlite3` CLI. Pulled primary sources and posed the decision-flipping
  questions.
- 💡 **Why:** A wallet is correctness-critical; choosing the driver, repo model and test posture
  up front avoids expensive rework. 📚 [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/),
  [sqlite.org/wal](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html).

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 02 — Decisions locked

Answers to the interrogation, which set the project's direction:

| Question | Decision | ✅/✏️ |
|----------|----------|:----:|
| SQLite driver | **`modernc.org/sqlite`** (pure Go, no C compiler) — portability | ✅ |
| SQLite CLI? | Not needed; service persists to a `.db` file | ✏️ |
| Repo visibility | **Public** | ✏️ |
| Repo tooling | Install **`gh` CLI** | ✅ |
| Prompt log style | Curated "asked / accepted / edited / why" (this file) | ✅ |
| Go install | Via **winget** | ✅ |
| Editor | VS Code present; primary dev via the coding agent | — |
| Scope | **Over-deliver:** OpenAPI + Swagger UI, Playwright tests, strict TDD, Docker | ✏️ |

- 💡 **Why pure-Go driver:** with no C compiler installed, `mattn/go-sqlite3` would add a MinGW
  detour and break clone-and-run; `modernc.org/sqlite` trades some write speed (irrelevant here)
  for zero-toolchain portability. 📚 [driver trade-off](https://datastation.multiprocess.io/blog/2022-05-12-sqlite-in-go-with-and-without-cgo.html).

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 03 — Plumbing execution kicked off

- 🧑 **Asked:** Go for it — set up the environment and the repo.
- 🤖 **Did:** Installed Go + `gh` via winget (background); added a task for **gopls** (the official
  Go LSP server) so the agent and VS Code get fast code navigation; scaffolded the repo
  (`README.md`, `SOLUTION.md`, this log, `.gitignore`, shared `.vscode/` config).
- ✏️ **Steered:** Added gopls + LSP wiring on top of the base ask, after I flagged needing a
  language server for the agent.
- 💡 **Why:** gopls is installed separately from the compiler (`go install
  golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest`) and lives in `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`, which isn't on PATH by
  default — handling it now prevents "command not found" later.
  📚 [gopls](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls).

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 04 — Plumbing complete ✅

- 🤖 **Did:** Installed the toolchain via winget and verified everything end-to-end:

  | Tool | Version | Notes |
  |------|---------|-------|
  | Go | `go1.26.4 windows/amd64` | latest stable |
  | GitHub CLI | `gh 2.94.0` | was already installed → upgraded |
  | gopls (Go LSP) | `v0.22.0` | on PATH at `C:\Users\User-PC\go\bin` |

- ✅ **Accepted:** `gh` turned out to be **already authenticated** (account `ossewawiel`, SSH,
  `repo` scope) — so no interactive login was needed.
- 🤖 **Did:** Created the **public** repo and pushed the first commit:
  **https://github.com/ossewawiel/gowallet** (remote `origin` over SSH; `main` tracks `origin/main`).
- 💡 **Why this order:** install → refresh PATH in-session → verify each tool → only then create the
  repo, so a broken tool surfaces immediately instead of mid-push.

**Step 1 outcome:** environment ready, repo live, recording in place. ➡️ Next: **Step 2 — dev system**
(project layout, TDD harness, OpenAPI/Swagger, Docker, CI).

## Step 2 — Dev system

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 05 — Stack locked + development system built ✅

- 🧑 **Asked:** What Go libs/frameworks to use, then set up CLAUDE.md, skills, subagents, GitHub
  issue templates, and an issue-driven, vertical-slice, TDD workflow. Tone: casual banter, low
  lingo, visual output — *going forward, always*.
- 🤖 **Did:** Ran a two-round interrogation with primary sources, then locked the stack and built
  the system.

  | Decision | Pick | Killed |
  |----------|------|--------|
  | Routing | stdlib `net/http` (1.22) + `chi` | gin / echo / fiber |
  | API contract | spec-first `oapi-codegen` + `kin-openapi` | code-first / hand-rolled |
  | DB access | `sqlc` + `goose` (timestamped) | GORM / sqlx |
  | Auth | JWT **HS256** (`golang-jwt`, method pinned) | opaque / PASETO / RS256 |
  | Testing | Schemathesis (contract) + Go `-race` (invariants) | Playwright on contract path |

- ✏️ **Steered:** Source of truth = **two layers** (OpenAPI spec + `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` invariants
  registry). Concurrency proven by **parallel-submission `-race` tests** (no load tool). **3 parallel
  streams**, **auth midstream**. JWT confirmed over PASETO.
- 💡 **Why JWT HS256, not RS256:** gowallet is a single service that signs *and* verifies — RS256's
  public-key split buys nothing here; HS256 + `WithValidMethods` is simpler and dodges alg-confusion.
- 🤖 **Built:** `CLAUDE.md` (golden rules + house voice + prompt-log rule), 5 `docs/` guides
  (architecture, REST, dev-flow, acceptance, slices), 3 skills (`go-architecture`,
  `rest-api-standards`, `tdd-workflow`), 2 subagents (`doc-updater`, `tdd-runner`), 4 commands
  (`design-slice`, `build-slice`, `quality-gate`, `log-progress`), and GitHub slice issue templates.
- 💡 **The model:** a command pulls the right skills → which read the right docs → enforcing process
  flow + feedback + progression. Design happens in the main session → a fully-specced GitHub issue →
  a fresh session (`tdd-runner`) builds it with no re-design.

**Step 2 outcome:** the factory is built. ➡️ Next: **Step 3 — execution** (start at slice **S0**,
the walking skeleton, via `/design-slice`).

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 06 — Prompt-log rule: go granular

- 🧑 **Asked:** Make prompt-log entries more granular; update the rules (not just this one entry).
- 🔎 **Explored:** Where the rule lives — `CLAUDE.md` (standing order), `.claude/agents/doc-updater.md`
  (the writer's spec), and this file's legend. Weighed rewriting past entries vs rules-only →
  chose rules-only (can backfill on request).
- ✅ **Accepted:** "One entry per exchange/decision" granularity + a richer entry skeleton.
- ✏️ **Edited:** Added icons to the format — 🔎 explored, ❌ rejected, 🔗 artifacts.
- 🤖 **Did:** Updated `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/doc-updater.md`, and this file's legend. This entry
  is the first written in the new style.
- 💡 **Why:** The brief grades the AI workflow — finer grain shows the real reasoning and the roads
  not taken, not just milestones.
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** CLAUDE.md · docs/PROMPT_LOG.md · .claude/agents/doc-updater.md

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 07 — README tracks progression, updated every push

- 🧑 **Asked:** README wasn't reflecting the latest progress; it should track progression and be
  updated on every push.
- 🤖 **Did:** Refreshed `README.md` (Step 1 ✅ + Step 2 ✅ + Step 3 next, new **Progress** section,
  locked tech-stack table, updated layout). Added a standing order in `CLAUDE.md` + the quality gate,
  and gave `doc-updater` ownership of README progression.
- ✅ **Accepted:** "Update README every push" as a definition-of-done item.
- 💡 **Why:** README is the front door — a reviewer should see current state at a glance without
  digging through the prompt log.
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** README.md · CLAUDE.md · .claude/agents/doc-updater.md

## Step 3 — Execution

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 08 — Slice catalogue finalized (8 → 6)

- 🧑 **Asked:** Split Step 3 into slices, generate a kickoff prompt per slice for fresh sessions, and
  lay out an order that hits parallelism ASAP.
- 🔎 **Explored:** Re-read the brief and pressure-tested the Step-2 `SLICES.md` against primary
  sources — Cockburn's walking skeleton, the IETF idempotency-key draft, Russ Cox on Go layout.
- ✅ **Accepted:** keep S0 a pure walking skeleton · bake concurrency into S1/S2 (no separate
  hardening slice) · keep audit its own slice for parallelism · `ref` IS the idempotency key (body,
  `UNIQUE`).
- ✏️ **Edited:** collapsed accounts+earn into one slice (S1) · flattened the 5-package `internal/` to
  **3 packages** (`httpapi → wallet ← sqlitestore`) · auth (S3) runs parallel from right after S0.
- ❌ **Rejected:** layering an IETF `Idempotency-Key` header on top of `ref` (overkill for the brief);
  the 5-package layout (Go team favours simpler).
- 💡 **Why:** fewer, honest slices; only S0 is truly serial; a reviewer reads a 3-package tree in minutes.
- 📚 [Cockburn](https://yoshi389111.github.io/kinokobooks/soft_en/Start_with_a_Walking_Skeleton.htm) ·
  [IETF idempotency draft-07](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header-07) ·
  [Russ Cox on layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout/issues/117)
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** docs/SLICES.md · docs/ARCHITECTURE.md · docs/ACCEPTANCE.md

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 09 — Slice prompts + GitHub issues created

- 🤖 **Did:** Wrote 6 medium kickoff prompts (`docs/slices/S0–S5.md`) + a run-order guide
  (`docs/slices/README.md`); created the `slice` + `stream-a/b/c` labels and **opened 6 issues
  (#1–#6)** straight from the prompt files; remapped the ACCEPTANCE invariants to the new slice IDs;
  taught `/design-slice` to enrich an existing issue instead of opening a duplicate.
- ✅ **Accepted:** one file per slice + a master order doc; medium-rich prompts (intent + invariants +
  traps + deps), not full pre-designs.
- 💡 **Why:** each issue is a fresh-session entry point — paste prompt → `/design-slice` fleshes the
  issue → `/build-slice` ships it. Build starts at **S0 (#1)**.
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** docs/slices/*.md · GitHub issues #1–#6 · .claude/commands/design-slice.md

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 10 — S0 designed (walking skeleton, design-only)

- 🧑 **Asked:** Run `/design-slice` for **S0** — the walking skeleton (architecture tracer bullet).
  Design-only; no production code yet.
- 🔎 **Explored:**
  - **INV-n rows for S0?** → ❌ No. `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` is scoped to *business + concurrency*
    invariants; S0 has neither (it's the structural tracer). The S0 slice doc already says
    "Invariants: none." So no rows added.
  - **Does `/healthz` belong in the OpenAPI contract?** → ✅ Yes, so Schemathesis can fuzz it.
    `/openapi.yaml` and `/swagger` stay **infra routes**, not spec paths.
  - **Empty initial goose migration?** → ✅ Yes, intentionally empty (`SELECT 1` up/down). goose still
    creates `goose_db_version` on startup, which the acceptance test asserts — proves the runner works
    **without inventing tables S1 owns**.
  - **Seed the shared Error envelope now?** → ✅ Yes, even though `/healthz` doesn't need it — so every
    later slice reuses **one** error shape (per REST guidelines).
  - **Health seam design:** `wallet` defines a `Pinger` interface + `HealthService`; `sqlitestore`
    implements `Pinger` via `*sql.DB.PingContext`; `httpapi` calls `wallet`. Proves the layering
    direction `httpapi → wallet ← sqlitestore` through a trivial path.
- 🤖 **Did:** Read the S0 slice doc + `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ACCEPTANCE.md`, `SLICES.md`,
  `REST_API_GUIDELINES.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md`, and the slice issue template. Confirmed the repo has
  **no `go.mod`/`api/` yet** (S0 creates them). **Enriched GitHub issue #1** (was just the kickoff
  prompt) with the full build spec: OpenAPI fragment (`/healthz` + Health + Error schemas), timestamped
  goose migration (`20260618000000_init.sql`), domain/health seam, a **7-test red list**, acceptance
  criteria, and build order. Issue updated via `gh issue edit 1 --body-file`.
- ✅ **Accepted:** the full S0 design above.
- ❌ **Rejected:** adding `INV-n` rows for S0 — no business/concurrency invariant exists to prove.
- 💡 **Why:** S0 is a **kept walking skeleton** (Cockburn), not a throwaway spike — nailing the
  3-package wiring + DB PRAGMAs + migration runner *once* means every later slice slots in. Tests still
  ship (health path, PRAGMAs, migration runner) so production habits hold from line one.
- 📚 `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (3-package layout, PRAGMAs, wire-crossing rule) · `docs/DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md`
  (TDD loop) · `docs/REST_API_GUIDELINES.md` (error envelope, status codes) · `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md`
  (invariant scope).
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** GitHub issue #1 (enriched) — https://github.com/ossewawiel/gowallet/issues/1 ·
  no code commits (design-only).

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 11 — S0 built (walking skeleton, red→green→quality-gate) ✅

- 🧑 **Asked:** Run `/build-slice` for **S0** (issue #1) — strict spec-first TDD. First slice, so
  scaffold the repo from scratch.
- 🔎 **Explored / decisions in-build:**
  - **Schemathesis caught a real contract nit:** `GET /healthz` with a bad method returned `405`
    but **no `Allow` header** — RFC 9110 wants one. Fixed with a `MethodNotAllowed` handler that
    sets `Allow`, plus an **8th test** `TestHealthz_405_HasAllowHeader` — wrote the failing test
    *first*, then re-greened. TDD held even for the contract fix. ✅
  - **Hand-written JSON bytes for `/healthz`** (not `json.Marshal` of a map) — guarantees key order
    matches the spec example byte-for-byte. ✅
  - **PRAGMAs ride on the SQLite DSN**; write path pins `SetMaxOpenConns(1)`. ✅
  - **Layering verified with `go list -deps`:** `httpapi` imports `wallet` + `gen`, **never**
    `sqlitestore`; `wallet` imports nothing internal. The arrow `httpapi → wallet ← sqlitestore`
    holds structurally, not just by convention. ✅
- 🤖 **Did:** Branched `slice/s0-skeleton` off `main`. Scaffolded the repo:
  - `go.mod` (module `github.com/ossewawiel/gowallet`, Go 1.26.4)
  - `api/openapi.yaml` (`/healthz` + shared `Error` envelope)
  - `oapi-codegen` strict chi-server output → `internal/httpapi/gen/`
  - `internal/httpapi` (router, middleware, `health.go`, `errors.go` envelope + 404/405,
    `infra.go` for `/openapi.yaml` + `/swagger`)
  - `internal/wallet` (`Pinger`, `Health`, `HealthService`)
  - `internal/sqlitestore` (`Open` w/ PRAGMAs, `Migrate` via goose, `Ping`) + timestamped empty
    migration `20260618000000_init.sql`
  - `cmd/gowallet/main.go` wiring it all together
  - **8 tests** (7 from the issue + the 405 one). Loop: red → green → refactor → full quality gate.
- ✅ **Accepted:** every gate green — `gofmt` clean · `go vet` 0 · `golangci-lint` 0 issues ·
  `go build` ok · `go test -race` ok · Schemathesis **9 cases, no issues**. All S0 acceptance
  criteria met.
- 💡 **Why:** S0 is a **kept** walking skeleton, not a spike — getting the 3-package wiring +
  PRAGMAs + migration runner right *once* means every later slice slots straight in.
- 🛠️ **Tooling notes worth keeping:**
  - `-race` on Windows needs a **real gcc** — installed MinGW **gcc 16.1.0** via `scoop install
    mingw` (Go rejects MSVC-targeted clang's `-mthreads`). Future race runs: put
    `C:\Users\User-PC\scoop\apps\mingw\current\bin` on PATH + `CGO_ENABLED=1`.
  - Schemathesis (Python) needs `PYTHONUTF8=1` on cp1252 consoles.
- 📚 GitHub issue #1 (the build spec) · `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` · `docs/DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md` ·
  `docs/REST_API_GUIDELINES.md` · RFC 9110 (`Allow` header on 405).
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** branch `slice/s0-skeleton` (not yet pushed/committed at time of writing) ·
  files created — `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `api/openapi.yaml`, `internal/httpapi/*` (+`gen`),
  `internal/wallet/health.go`, `internal/sqlitestore/*` (+migration), `cmd/gowallet/main.go`,
  tests in `internal/*/*_test.go` + `test/acceptance/healthz_test.go`. Closes #1 once the PR merges.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 12 — S1 designed (Accounts + Earn + Balance, design-only)

- 🧑 **Asked:** Run `/design-slice` for **S1** — Accounts + Earn + Balance. Design-only; enrich the
  existing GitHub issue **#2**, no production code.
- 🔎 **Explored / decisions weighed (and roads not taken):**
  - **`account_id` is client-supplied** (brief's example `"member-123"`), not server-generated → a
    duplicate create is a **409 `account_exists`**. (Not auto-incrementing IDs the server hands back.)
  - **Idempotent replay** of a known `ref` returns **200** with the *stored* txn (first-write-wins) —
    **not 201, not 409**. Replay with a *different* payload still returns the stored txn; `ref` is the
    idempotency key. ❌ Rejected: 409-on-replay; ❌ rejected: comparing payloads to detect conflicts.
  - **`kind` enum is `[earn]`-only** in the S1 spec, so `kin-openapi` bounces a `spend` at the edge
    (**400**). The DB `CHECK` already allows `('earn','spend')` → S2 widens the enum with **no
    migration churn**.
  - **Balance is DERIVED** — `SUM` over rows, not a stored running-balance column → no dual-write, and
    INV-5 durability falls out for free. Query written with the full `Σ(earn) − Σ(spend)` formula now,
    so S2 needs **zero balance-code change**. ❌ Rejected: a stored balance column.
  - **Atomicity:** `RecordTransaction` does account-lookup + `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT(ref) DO NOTHING`
    in **one `sql.Tx`**; `RowsAffected` `1 ⇒ created (201)`, `0 ⇒ replay (200)`. Single writer
    (`SetMaxOpenConns(1)`) serialises racing inserts → **INV-2**. This same tx is the seam S2 extends
    with the balance / no-negative check.
  - **Identity seam:** handlers read identity **only** via a `subjectAccountID(r)` resolver — S1 reads
    body/path, S3 swaps it to `r.Context()` + adds the 403 check. A **swap, not a rewrite** — makes
    INV-6 meaningful right now.
  - **Txn against an unknown account** → **404 `account_not_found`** (the FK backstops it).
- 🤖 **Did:** Read the brief PDF + `ARCHITECTURE`/`REST`/`ACCEPTANCE`/`SLICES` docs and the S0 code.
  Designed the REST cycle (`POST /accounts`, `GET /accounts/{id}`, `POST /transactions` (earn),
  `GET /accounts/{id}/balance`), the OpenAPI fragment (4 paths + `NewAccount`/`Account`/
  `NewTransaction`/`Transaction`/`Balance` schemas + stateful links), the goose migration
  `20260618120000_s1_accounts_and_transactions.sql` (accounts + transactions, `UNIQUE(ref)`,
  `points > 0` CHECK, `kind` CHECK), domain interfaces + sentinels, and the full red-test list.
  **Enriched GitHub issue #2** with the complete design (zero further design questions).
- ✅ **Accepted:** the full S1 design above, landed on issue #2. Invariants **INV-1/2/5/6** left
  unchanged in `ACCEPTANCE.md` — already registered for S1, status ⬜ (tests not written yet).
- 💡 **Why:** spec-first vertical slice; correctness comes from **SQL constraints + a single writer**,
  not app-level locking; concurrency tests ship *with* the slice, not bolted on later.
- 📚 `docs/specifications.pdf` (brief — final word) · `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` ·
  `docs/REST_API_GUIDELINES.md` · `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` · `docs/SLICES.md`.
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** GitHub issue #2 (enriched) — https://github.com/ossewawiel/gowallet/issues/2 ·
  planned migration `internal/sqlitestore/migrations/20260618120000_s1_accounts_and_transactions.sql` ·
  no code commits (design-only).

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 13 — S3 designed (Auth: JWT member/admin, design-only)

- 🧑 **Asked:** Run `/design-slice` for **S3** — Auth (JWT, member/admin). Design-only; enrich the
  existing GitHub issue **#4**, no production code.
- 🔎 **Explored / decisions weighed (and roads not taken):**
  - **Stateless JWT HS256 → no DB, no migration** for this slice. Auth is pure verification + a pure
    rule, so S3 carries **zero schema** and parallelizes straight off S0 (doesn't wait on S1's tables).
    Brief explicitly leaves the token scheme to us.
  - **`POST /token` is a demo token mint**, not a credential login — `{account_id, role}` → signed
    JWT. No password store is in scope (documented as a trade-off). `/token` is **DB-free** (no
    account-existence check), which keeps S3 independent of **S1**.
  - **Layer split stays at 3 packages:** verification (parse Bearer, pin HS256, extract claims) lives
    as `httpapi` **middleware**; the authorization rule (member-own vs admin-any) is a **pure function
    in `wallet`** — `Authorize(Identity, target) → ErrForbidden`. `Identity`/`Role` types live in
    `wallet`, so the domain owns the rule and the edge owns the crypto.
  - **Spec strategy:** a **global `security: [bearerAuth]`** default + per-op `security: []` opt-outs
    for `/token` and `/healthz`. Net effect: the moment S1/S2 endpoints enter the spec they're
    **protected by default** — no per-endpoint wiring to forget. New sentinel `ErrForbidden` → 403.
  - **Algorithm pinned** via `jwt.WithValidMethods(["HS256"])` → kills `alg:none` + RS↔HS confusion
    (INV-12).
  - **New config:** `GOWALLET_JWT_SECRET` (required, **fail-fast at boot**) + `GOWALLET_JWT_TTL`
    (default `1h`).
- 🤖 **Did:** Enriched **GitHub issue #4** with the full build spec — OpenAPI fragment, the "no
  migration" note, domain rules, the red-test list, and acceptance criteria. Added invariants
  **INV-12** (alg pinning) + **INV-13** (identity-from-token-only) to `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md`.
- ✅ **Accepted:** the full S3 design above. Invariants: **INV-7/INV-8** (pre-existing for S3) +
  **INV-12/INV-13** newly registered, all status ⬜.
- 💡 **Why:** stateless HS256 means a single service that signs *and* verifies — no key split, no DB,
  no migration; identity from the verified token only is what makes member-own enforcement real.
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** GitHub issue #4 (enriched) — https://github.com/ossewawiel/gowallet/issues/4 ·
  `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` · branch `slice/s0-skeleton` · no code commits (design-only).

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 14 — S1 built (Accounts + Earn + Balance, red→green→quality-gate) ✅

- 🧑 **Asked:** Run `/build-slice 2` — build **S1** end-to-end with strict spec-first TDD via the
  `tdd-runner` subagent.
- 🔎 **Explored / decisions in-build:**
  - **Branch base correction:** local `main` was **2 commits stale** — S0 was in fact already merged
    to `origin/main` via **PR #7**. Branched `slice/s1-accounts-earn` off the up-to-date main (no
    re-merge needed) rather than off the stale local tip.
  - **Wired the `kin-openapi` request validator** (`internal/httpapi/validate.go`) — S0 hadn't needed
    it (only `/healthz`). **Scoped to spec routes**, infra routes untouched. Without it, Schemathesis
    caught `additionalProperties` **bypasses** slipping through.
  - **Spec tightened (spec-first, no behavior hacks)** to pass Schemathesis stateful:
    - documented **400** on the GET-by-id routes + a shared-envelope `ErrorHandlerFunc` for malformed
      path escapes;
    - `account_id` constrained to `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$`, `maxLength 64`, so ids round-trip cleanly as
      **path segments**;
    - `points` given `maximum` = int64-max so an over-`int64` value is **rejected at the edge**.
  - **Fixed a latent S0 spec bug:** `Error.message` description had an **unquoted comma** → YAML parsed
    a stray sibling key that `kin-openapi` rejected; now quoted (prose-only, **no codegen impact**).
  - **Atomicity landed as designed:** `sqlitestore.Store.RecordTransaction` does account-lookup +
    `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT(ref) DO NOTHING` + read-back in **one `sql.Tx`**; `RowsAffected`
    `1 ⇒ created (201)`, `0 ⇒ replay (200)`. Single writer serialises the race. **This is the seam S2
    extends.**
  - **Identity seam:** `subjectAccountID(r, candidate)` in `internal/httpapi/identity.go` — S1 returns
    the body/path candidate; **S3 swaps to `r.Context()`**. Handlers only ever call it.
  - **Balance is derived** (`SUM` over rows), not stored → **INV-5 durability is automatic**.
- 🤖 **Did:** spec-first **RED** (4 paths + 5 schemas + links in `api/openapi.yaml`, regen via
  `oapi-codegen`; failing unit/store/acceptance tests) → **GREEN** (migration
  `20260618120000_s1_accounts_and_transactions.sql`, `sqlc` queries + gen, `wallet` domain,
  `sqlitestore` impl, `httpapi` handlers, `main.go` wiring) → **REFACTOR** → **PROVE**. Installed

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 15 — S3 built (Auth: JWT member/admin, red→green→quality-gate) ✅

- 🧑 **Asked:** Run `/build-slice 4` — build **S3** (Auth) end-to-end with strict spec-first TDD via
  the `tdd-runner` subagent (red → green → refactor → prove).
- 🔎 **Explored / decisions in-build:**
  - **Stateless JWT HS256 → no DB, no migration.** Identity rides in the signed token; S3 carries
    **zero schema**. ❌ Rejected: a sessions/credentials table — out of scope, and the brief leaves
    the token scheme to us.
  - **Algorithm pinned** via `jwt.WithValidMethods(["HS256"])` → kills `alg:none` and RS↔HS
    confusion (**INV-12**). ❌ Rejected: accepting the token's self-declared `alg`.
  - **Layer split stays at 3 packages.** JWT *verification* (parse Bearer, pin HS256, extract
    claims) is `httpapi` **middleware**; the authorization *rule* is a **pure function in `wallet`**
    — `Authorize`, with `Identity`/`Role` types + an `ErrForbidden` sentinel. The domain owns the
    rule, the edge owns the crypto. ✅
  - **`role` kept as a `minLength:1` string, NOT a schema enum.** An *unknown* role must surface as a
    semantic **422** (handler's `ParseRole`); a schema enum would make `kin-openapi` bounce it as a
    **400** at the edge — wrong signal. ✏️ Side effect: the Schemathesis gate run uses
    `--exclude-checks positive_data_acceptance`, since a 422 on a *schema-valid-but-unknown* role is
    an intentional business rule, not a contract bug.
  - **Midstream S1 integration:** flipped the S1 handlers (`GetAccount`, `GetBalance`,
    `CreateTransaction`) from reading `account_id` in the body/URL to reading the **verified identity
    from request context** + `wallet.Authorize`. This is exactly the identity-seam swap S1 designed
    for (`subjectAccountID`) — a swap, not a rewrite — and it's what makes **INV-13** real.
  - **Latent issue flagged for a future slice:** a possible **int64 overflow** in the S1 balance
    `SUM` — noted out of S3 scope, to be handled where it belongs.
- 🤖 **Did:** spec-first **RED** (global `security: [bearerAuth]` default + `security: []` opt-outs,
  `POST /token`, regen via `oapi-codegen`; failing unit/acceptance tests) → **GREEN**
  (`internal/wallet/auth.go` — `Authorize`/`Identity`/`Role`/`ErrForbidden`; `internal/httpapi/auth.go`
  — verification middleware; `internal/httpapi/token.go` — demo token mint + `ParseRole`; S1 handler
  rewire) → **REFACTOR** → **PROVE**. **Config:** `GOWALLET_JWT_SECRET` (required, **fail-fast at
  boot**) + `GOWALLET_JWT_TTL` (default `1h`), read in `cmd/gowallet/main.go`. Added dep
  **`github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5`**.
- ✅ **Accepted:** all of it — quality gate **green** (gofmt · vet · golangci-lint clean ·
  `go build ./...` ok · `go test -race ./...` green · Schemathesis **1174 passed / 0 failures** ·
  boot fail-fast on missing secret verified). **INV-7/INV-8/INV-12/INV-13 proven.**
- 🧪 **Tests added:** `TestAccess_MemberOwnOnly`, `TestAccess_AdminAny`, `TestVerify_AlgNone_Rejected`,
  `TestVerify_NonHS256_Rejected`, `TestAuth_AlgConfusion_Rejected`, `TestAuth_IdentityFromTokenOnly`
  (+ supporting unit tests), landed in `test/acceptance/s3_auth_test.go` and the package test files.
- 💡 **Why:** a single service that signs *and* verifies needs no key split, no DB, no migration —
  HS256 + method pinning is simpler and dodges alg-confusion; identity from the **verified token
  only** is what makes member-own enforcement actually enforceable.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 16 — S2 designed (Spend + no-negative guard, design-only)

- 🧑 **Asked:** Run `/design-slice` for **S2** — members can **spend** points; reject any spend that
  would push the balance **below zero**; bake **concurrency safety (`-race`)** in now. Enforce
  **INV-3** (negative spend → **409**) and **INV-4** (concurrent spends never overdraw, final balance
  exact). Design-only; no production code.
- 🔎 **Explored / decisions weighed (and roads not taken):**
  - **The crux — keep balance-check + write atomic with no read-then-write gap:**
    - ❌ **Rejected (a):** read balance first, then insert the spend if it's OK. Leaves a window two
      concurrent spends can both slip through (both read "enough", both write → overdraw).
    - ✅ **Chosen (b):** `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` **first**, then within the **same
      `sql.Tx`** recompute `BalanceForAccount` (which now *includes* the just-inserted spend) and
      **`tx.Rollback()`** if it came out `< 0`. The single writer (`SetMaxOpenConns(1)`) serialises
      racing spends, so each sees every committed prior spend → **INV-4 holds by construction**, not
      by hope.
  - **Idempotent replay skips the balance check** — a known `ref` replaying just returns the stored
    txn (first-write-wins already validated it). Re-checking would be wrong (and pointless).
- 🤖 **Did:** Enriched **GitHub issue #3** with the full design — OpenAPI fragment, domain rules, the
  red-test list, and acceptance criteria. **No production code written.**
- ✅ **Accepted — zero schema change.** S1's migration already carries everything S2 needs:
  `CHECK(kind IN ('earn','spend'))`, `UNIQUE(ref)`, `points > 0`, and `BalanceForAccount` already
  computes `Σearn − Σspend`. So S2 reuses it all — **no new migration, no new `sqlc` query**. The new
  work is small and surgical:

  | New work | Where |
  |----------|-------|
  | `ErrInsufficientBalance` sentinel | `internal/wallet` |
  | `WalletService.RecordSpend` (mirrors `RecordEarn`) | `internal/wallet` |
  | In-tx balance guard (rollback if `< 0`) | `internal/sqlitestore.RecordTransaction` |
  | **409** mapping (the one place) | `internal/httpapi/errors.go` |
  | Widen `kind` guard + openapi enum → `[earn, spend]` + a 409 response | handler + `api/openapi.yaml` |

- 💡 **Why:** keeping the guard **SQL-level and inside one tx** is the money-rules golden rule — the
  check and the write can't be torn apart by a concurrent racer. Reusing S1's seam (designed to be
  extended) means S2 is mostly a *widening*, not a rewrite.
- 📚 `docs/specifications.pdf` ("Do not allow a spend that would drive the balance below zero") ·
  `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` INV-3/INV-4 · S1 code (`internal/sqlitestore/accounts.go` `RecordTransaction`,
  `queries.sql` `BalanceForAccount`).
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** GitHub issue #3 (enriched) — https://github.com/ossewawiel/gowallet/issues/3 ·
  no code commits (design-only). INV-3/INV-4 left at ⬜ in `ACCEPTANCE.md` (build hasn't happened).

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 17 — S6 added: real login (credential-based token issuance)

- 🧑 **Asked:** Is there anything for an admin/user to actually **log in** for a JWT? And: publish the
  test usernames/passwords in the README for testing, noting it's temporary until full auth is built.
- 🔎 **Explored:** Authentication (login) vs authorization (the JWT verify + roles S3 already shipped).
  The brief's Task 2 only requires *authorization* — token issuance is "up to us" — so S3's demo
  `/token` mint is in-spec. Options weighed: keep demo mint + document caveat · **thin credential
  login** · full user management.
- ✅ **Accepted:** the **thin login** — new slice **S6**: bcrypt-hashed secrets on accounts, seed a
  member + admin, `POST /login` verifies → JWT carrying the **stored** role. Pure-Go bcrypt, stays in
  the 3-package layout, no signup/reset.
- ❌ **Rejected:** full user-management (scope creep beyond the brief) · leaving demo-mint-only.
- 🤖 **Did:** Wrote `docs/slices/S6.md` (kickoff prompt with seed creds + the README-publish + the
  "temporary measure" note), opened **issue #10** (`slice,stream-b`), registered **INV-14–17** in
  `ACCEPTANCE.md`, added S6 to `SLICES.md` + the slice index, and published a **🔑 Test credentials**
  table in `README.md` with the stop-gap caveat.
- 💡 **Why:** answers "how does a member/admin log in?", shows the authn-vs-authz split + password
  hashing, stays minimal. Seeded creds in the README are a graded-demo convenience, clearly flagged
  as temporary.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 18 — S2 built (Spend + no-negative guard, red→green→quality-gate) ✅

- 🧑 **Asked:** Run `/build-slice 3` — build **S2** (spend + atomic no-negative guard) end-to-end
  with strict spec-first TDD.
- 🔎 **Explored / decisions in-build:**
  - **Reuse over add (zero schema change):** S1's rails already cover spend — `CHECK(kind IN
    ('earn','spend'))`, `UNIQUE(ref)`, and `BalanceForAccount` computing `Σearn − Σspend`. So S2
    adds **no new migration and no new `sqlc` query**. ❌ Rejected: a fresh migration/query — the
    issue explicitly flagged that as a smell.
  - **The guard design — collapse check-and-write into one tx:** inside the existing single `sql.Tx`
    in `sqlitestore.RecordTransaction`, insert first → if `affected == 1 && kind == spend`, recompute
    `BalanceForAccount` **in-tx** (it now includes the just-inserted spend) → `tx.Rollback()` if `< 0`,
    else commit. No read-then-write gap two racers could slip through.
- 🤖 **Did:** Branched `slice/s2-spend`. Widened the `kind` enum to `[earn, spend]` and added a
  **409** response to `createTransaction` in `api/openapi.yaml`; regenerated types via `oapi-codegen`
  (→ `NewTransactionKindSpend`). Added `wallet.ErrInsufficientBalance` sentinel + a `RecordSpend`
  service method (mirrors `RecordEarn`). Implemented the in-tx post-insert-then-check-and-rollback
  guard in `sqlitestore.RecordTransaction`. Mapped the error to **409 `insufficient_balance`** in
  `httpapi/errors.go`; added earn/spend routing in the `CreateTransaction` handler.
- ✅ **Accepted:** all of it — quality gate **green** (gofmt · go vet · golangci-lint **0 issues** ·
  go build · `go test -race ./...` · Schemathesis **269/269** on the spend+409 surface).
  **INV-3/INV-4 proven.**
- 💡 **Why the guard holds:** the single writer (`SetMaxOpenConns(1)`) serialises racing spends, so
  each sees every committed prior spend — two concurrent spends can't both pass a stale read.
  **INV-4 by construction**, not by hope. Keeping check + write SQL-level inside one tx is the
  money-rules golden rule.
- 🧪 **Proven:** **10 new tests** — 3 domain unit · 3 store integration · 4 acceptance (incl. the
  **16-concurrent-spend `-race`** test), landed in `test/acceptance/s2_spend_test.go` + package files.
- ⚠️ **Note:** the pre-existing `POST /token` **422** (semantic role validation, see Entry 15) is a
  documented non-issue — unrelated to S2.
- 📚 GitHub issue #3 (design) · `docs/specifications.pdf` ("Do not allow a spend that would drive the
  balance below zero") · `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` INV-3/INV-4 · S1's `RecordTransaction` seam.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 19 — S7 added: listing accounts + transactions

- 🧑 **Asked:** Can an admin **list** members and get a list back? And **list transactions**?
- 🔎 **Explored:** The surface only had fetch-by-id (`GET /accounts/{id}`, `/balance`) — no collection
  endpoints. The brief's *"admins can view any account"* reads naturally as enumeration; a transaction
  history is implied by "tracks balance." Options weighed: both + pagination · **both, no paging** ·
  transactions-only · skip-and-document.
- ✅ **Accepted:** **both, no pagination** (user's call) — new slice **S7**: `GET /accounts`
  (admin-only) + `GET /accounts/{id}/transactions` (member-own / admin-any).
- ❌ **Rejected:** limit/offset paging for now (flagged as the production upgrade in the slice doc).
- 🤖 **Did:** Wrote `docs/slices/S7.md`, opened **issue #13** (`slice,stream-a`), registered
  **INV-18/19/20** in `ACCEPTANCE.md`, added S7 to `SLICES.md` + the slice index + README progress.
- 💡 **Why:** reads only (no migration) — reuses the S3 access rule + the derived-balance query;
  fills the obvious admin/member read gap.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 20 — Audit log made listable (folded into S4)

- 🧑 **Asked:** And listing the audit log?
- 🔎 **Explored:** Where `GET /audit` belongs — a standalone listings slice would chain the S7 reads
  behind S4. Since **S4 owns the audit table** (and isn't built yet), the read endpoint is most
  cohesive there.
- ✅ **Accepted:** add **`GET /audit`** (admin-only, optional `?account_id=` filter, no paging) to
  **S4** rather than S7.
- 🤖 **Did:** Enhanced `docs/slices/S4.md` + **synced issue #5** (`gh issue edit 5`), registered
  **INV-21** in `ACCEPTANCE.md`, updated `SLICES.md` (S4 row).
- 💡 **Why:** keeps the audit read with its writer; avoids coupling the buildable-now S7 to the
  not-yet-built S4.
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** docs/slices/S4.md · GitHub issue #5 (synced) · ACCEPTANCE INV-21 · SLICES.md.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 21 — S4 designed (Audit trail, design-only)

- 🧑 **Asked:** `/design-slice S4` — Audit trail: a durable, append-only record of every txn attempt
  (reason + timestamp), an **admin-only `GET /audit`**, and a writer service S5 can lean on.
- 🔎 **Explored — scope:** build the audit *machinery* standalone (table + `AuditService` writer +
  `GET /audit`) but **don't** wire it into `POST /transactions` in S4. The classic trap — "audit must
  never change the correctness of the money path" — is honored trivially by *not touching* it. The
  brief only requires auditing the **batch** attempts, so **S5 (CSV batch)** becomes the writer's
  first real caller. Keeps S4 standalone + shippable.
- ✅ **Accepted — table design, 3 deliberate breaks from `transactions`:**

  | Field | `transactions` | `audit_log` | Why the difference |
  |-------|----------------|-------------|--------------------|
  | `ref` | `UNIQUE` (idempotency) | **not unique** | append-only — duplicates are *events to record* |
  | `account_id` | FK to accounts | **no FK** | must record attempts against *unknown* accounts |
  | `kind` / `points` | constrained | **unconstrained** | faithfully record a *rejected* attempt, invalid values and all |
  | `outcome` | — | `CHECK(outcome IN ('accepted','rejected','duplicate'))` | our one controlled vocabulary |

- ✅ **Accepted — newest-first = `ORDER BY id DESC`**, not `created_at DESC`: `created_at` is only
  second-precision, so same-second rows tie; the `AUTOINCREMENT` id is strictly monotonic.
- ✅ **Accepted — `AuditEntry.kind` is a free string** in the OpenAPI schema (not the `earn|spend`
  enum) so a rejected row carrying an invalid kind doesn't violate its *own* contract.
- ✅ **Accepted — `GET /audit` returns a bare array** (`AuditLog`) — no pagination at demo scale,
  simplest thing for Schemathesis to chew on.
- ✅ **Accepted — admin-only via a new `requireAdmin(r)` transport helper**: identity from the
  verified token in context, **never** the URL. Reusable by S7's admin-only `GET /accounts`. `/audit`
  stays protected-by-default.
- ✅ **Accepted — new invariant INV-22** (append-only) on top of the pre-existing INV-11 / INV-21.
- 🤖 **Did:** enriched **GitHub issue #5** with the full design — OpenAPI fragment, timestamped
  migration `20260618130000_s4_audit_log.sql`, sqlc queries, domain/handler sketch, red-test list,
  and acceptance criteria. Acceptance seeding note: with **no HTTP write path** for audit in S4, a
  `bootRealAppWithStore` helper seeds rows via `store.AppendAudit`, then asserts through `GET /audit`.
  **No production code written — design only.**
- 💡 **Why:** the money path is the crown jewel; keeping audit a side-table with its own loose
  constraints means an audit failure can never corrupt a balance, and the writer is ready the moment
  S5 needs it.
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** GitHub issue #5 (https://github.com/ossewawiel/gowallet/issues/5) ·
  planned migration `internal/sqlitestore/migrations/20260618130000_s4_audit_log.sql` ·
  ACCEPTANCE INV-22.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 22 — S4 built (Audit trail, red→green→quality-gate) ✅

- 🧑 **Asked:** Run `/build-slice 5` — build **S4** (audit trail) end-to-end with strict spec-first
  TDD (red → green → refactor → prove).
- 🔎 **Explored / decisions in-build:**
  - **The money path stays untouched.** Audit is its own side-table written by its own insert,
    **never** inside the money `sql.Tx`. So an audit failure can't corrupt a balance — the golden
    rule holds by *not touching* the crown jewel. ✅ verified: `git diff main` on `wallet.go`,
    `sqlitestore/accounts.go`, and `httpapi/accounts.go` is **empty** — the earn/spend path is
    byte-for-byte unchanged.
  - **`audit_log` deliberately loosens the `transactions` constraints** (as designed in Entry 21):
    `ref` **not unique** (append-only), **no FK** on `account_id` (must record attempts against
    unknown accounts), **no CHECK** on `kind`/`points` (faithfully record a rejected attempt, junk
    values and all), and the *one* controlled vocabulary — `outcome CHECK`-constrained.
- 🤖 **Did:** Branched `slice/s4-audit`. **RED first** — the build broke on the regenerated
  `ServerInterface` now requiring `ListAudit`, and `wallet`/store tests failed on undefined
  `AuditEntry`/`AuditOutcome` → **GREEN** (min code) → small refactor. Added `GET /audit` +
  `AuditEntry`/`AuditLog` schemas to `api/openapi.yaml` (regen via `oapi-codegen`); timestamped
  migration `20260618130000_s4_audit_log.sql`; `sqlc` queries `AppendAuditEntry` / `ListAuditLog` /
  `ListAuditLogByAccount`; `wallet.AuditService` (append-only writer, validates outcome) +
  `AuditRepository`; `sqlitestore` impl; `internal/httpapi/audit.go` `ListAudit` handler + a new
  `requireAdmin` helper in `identity.go`; wired `Audit` into `httpapi.Deps` + `main.go`; factored a
  `bootRealAppWithStore` helper into the acceptance harness (no HTTP write path for audit in S4, so
  it seeds rows via the store, then asserts through `GET /audit`).
- 🧪 **Tests added:**
  - **domain** — `TestAuditService_Record_ValidatesOutcome`, `TestAuditService_Record_AppendsEveryCall`;
  - **store** — `TestAudit_RecordsEachAttempt` (**INV-11**), `TestAudit_AppendOnly_SameRefTwice`
    (**INV-22**), `TestAudit_ListNewestFirst`, `TestAudit_ListByAccount_FiltersAndNoLeak`;
  - **acceptance** — `TestListAudit_AdminOnly` (**INV-21**), `TestListAudit_RecordsShape`
    (**INV-21**), `TestListAudit_NoToken_401`.
- ✅ **Accepted:** quality gate **green** — gofmt · go vet · golangci-lint **0 issues** ·
  `go build ./...` · `go test -race ./...` (all packages) · Schemathesis (the new `GET /audit`
  passed clean in every phase incl. **stateful**). **INV-11 / INV-21 / INV-22 proven.**
- ⚠️ **Note:** the pre-existing `POST /token` **422** (semantic role validation, Entry 15) is the
  documented non-issue — unrelated to S4.
- 💡 **Why:** keeping audit a side-table with loose constraints + its own insert means an audit
  failure can never touch a balance, and the `AuditService` writer is ready the moment **S5 (CSV
  batch)** needs its first real caller.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 23 — S5 designed (CSV batch ingestion, design-only)

- 🧑 **Asked:** `/design-slice S5 — CSV batch ingestion`: a `POST /batch` multipart CSV upload (vs a
  CLI), idempotent on reprocess, returns summary counts, and audits each row. Enforce INV-9 & INV-10.
- 🔎 **Explored / decided:**
  - **Interface → `POST /batch` (multipart/form-data file upload)**, not a CLI. ❌ A CLI bypasses the
    contract layer; ✅ HTTP keeps it **spec-first**, Schemathesis-fuzzable, Bearer-protected, and
    demoable in Swagger for the Loom.
  - **Status → `200` synchronous** (process the whole file, return the summary). ❌ Rejected `202` —
    that's fire-and-forget async, and we're synchronous.
  - **Rejections are data, not HTTP errors:** bad rows / over-spend / unknown account → still `200`,
    tallied in the summary's `rejected`. Only a **broken upload** (no file part / unreadable header)
    → `400`. 💡 The batch *succeeded*; individual rows failing is a business outcome, not a transport
    error.
  - **Access → admin-only** (member → 403). 💡 A batch carries arbitrary `account_id`s across
    accounts, and only admin acts on any account — reuses the existing `requireAdmin` seam.
  - **Summary → counts only** (`processed / accepted / rejected / duplicates`). 💡 Brief asks for a
    *short* summary; per-row detail already lives in `GET /audit` (S4). Clean separation, no overlap.
  - **No migration, no new wallet logic.** A batch row is just another earn/spend, so it reuses
    everything: idempotency ← `transactions.ref` UNIQUE (S1); per-row attempt records ← `audit_log`
    (S4); same-account/concurrent safety ← S2's single-writer + atomic spend guard. The slice is a
    thin `internal/httpapi/batch.go` handler driving existing services (matches ARCHITECTURE: CSV
    ingestion lives as an httpapi handler).
  - **New invariant → INV-23** (batch path audits every row) on top of the pre-registered INV-9/INV-10.
- 🤖 **Did:** Enriched GitHub issue **#6** in place (`gh issue edit 6`) with the full design —
  OpenAPI fragment (`/batch` path + `BatchSummary` schema), the "no migration" note, an
  outcome-classification table, INV-9/10/23, the red-test list (acceptance + unit), acceptance
  criteria, and build notes. Registered **INV-23** in `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md`.
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** issue https://github.com/ossewawiel/gowallet/issues/6 · `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md`
  (INV-23 row).
- 💡 **Why it matters:** this is the **final feature slice** — it proves the duplicate/concurrency
  story end-to-end *through the batch path* while reusing every prior slice instead of adding new
  surface area.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-18 · Entry 24 — S5 built (CSV batch ingestion, red→green→quality-gate) ✅

- 🧑 **Asked:** Run `/build-slice 6` — build **S5** (CSV batch ingestion) end-to-end with strict
  spec-first TDD (red → green → refactor → prove).
- 🤖 **Did — spec-first RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → PROVE on branch `slice/s5-batch`:**
  - **Spec-first:** added `POST /batch` (admin-only, `multipart/form-data` file upload →
    `200 BatchSummary`) + the `BatchSummary` schema to `api/openapi.yaml`; regenerated with
    `oapi-codegen`. Also fixed an **unquoted YAML `400` description** whose em-dash + comma broke
    flow-mapping parsing — quoted it (contract-preserving, no codegen impact).
  - **New code:** `internal/httpapi/batch.go` — the `IngestBatch` handler + two pure, unit-tested
    helpers: `parseRow` (CSV row → `wallet.Transaction`) and `classifyOutcome` ((created, err) →
    audit outcome + reason + summary bucket). Parses with stdlib `encoding/csv` + `r.FormFile`.
  - **No migration, no new wallet/sqlitestore logic** — a batch row rides the existing
    `RecordEarn`/`RecordSpend` (idempotent via `transactions.ref` UNIQUE, S1), S2's single-writer +
    atomic spend guard, and the S4 audit writer (called **off the money path**, after each txn
    resolves). The slice is a thin transport handler driving services that already exist.
- ✅ **Accepted / decisions:**
  - **`200` synchronous with a summary** — rejected rows are **data**, not HTTP errors; tallied in
    the summary's `rejected`. Only a **broken upload** (missing file part / unreadable-or-absent CSV
    header) → **400**. Admin-only (member → **403**).
  - **Schemathesis false-positive handled by exclusion, not by loosening validation:** `/batch`
    tripped a `positive_data_acceptance` finding of the **same class** as the known `/token` 422 —
    Schemathesis sends an empty/headerless `format: binary` file and expects 2xx, but a headerless
    upload is a *documented* `400`. Per the issue, did **NOT** loosen validation; added
    `--exclude-checks positive_data_acceptance` (alongside the existing `negative_data_rejection`)
    and documented both as known non-issues in `CLAUDE.md`. All structural checks stay live and pass
    for `/batch`.
- 🧪 **Tests added:**
  - **unit** — `internal/httpapi/batch_test.go`: `TestParseRow_Valid` / `_ValidSpend` / `_Rejects`
    (7-case table) + `TestClassifyOutcome` (4-case table);
  - **acceptance** — `test/acceptance/s5_batch_test.go`: `TestBatch_Reprocess_Idempotent` (**INV-9**),
    `TestBatch_Summary` (**INV-10**), `TestBatch_AuditsEachRow` (**INV-23**),
    `TestBatch_SameAccountCloseTogether`, `TestBatch_ConcurrentReprocess_Idempotent` (`-race`),
    `TestBatch_AdminOnly`, `TestBatch_NoToken_401`, `TestBatch_BadUpload_400` + a `postBatch`
    multipart helper.
- ✅ **Gate green:** gofmt ✓ · go vet ✓ · golangci-lint **0 issues** ✓ · `go build ./...` ✓ ·
  `go test -race ./...` ✓ (incl. concurrent reprocess) · Schemathesis exit **0** ✓.
- 💡 **Why it matters:** the **final feature slice** — it proves the duplicate + concurrency story
  end-to-end *through the batch path* while reusing every prior slice, with **no new domain logic and
  no new tables**.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-19 · Entry 25 — SOLUTION.md re-synced + wired into the per-slice gate

- 🧑 **Asked:** SOLUTION.md drifted again — the skills aren't keeping it updated.
- 🔎 **Root cause:** README stayed current because it's in the quality gate **+** a CLAUDE standing
  order **+** a doc-updater job. `SOLUTION.md` was only *"update when a decision changes"*, so build
  sessions (correctly) skipped it on a normal slice. A wiring gap, not a skill failure.
- 🤖 **Did (re-sync):** Confirmed from git that S4 (#14) + S5 (#15) are merged. Flipped SOLUTION's
  built-vs-planned table (S4/S5 → ✅), added `POST /batch` + `GET /audit` to the API table, added the
  batch-reprocess + append-only-audit correctness rows, updated the invariant-status line (INV-1–13 &
  21–23 proven; only 14–20 left), and the footer.
- 🤖 **Did (the real fix — make it self-maintaining):** added `SOLUTION.md synced` to the quality gate
  in `CLAUDE.md` **and** the `tdd-workflow` skill; renamed the CLAUDE standing order to **"README +
  SOLUTION kept current"**; made `/build-slice` dispatch `doc-updater` to sync SOLUTION on green;
  strengthened the `doc-updater` SOLUTION job from "when a decision changes" → **"every time a slice
  lands"** with a concrete checklist; added a SOLUTION/README checkbox to the slice issue template.
- 💡 **Why:** the only reliable way to stop drift is to make SOLUTION part of the *definition of done*,
  in the same places that already keep README current — not hope a session remembers.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-19 · Entry 26 — S6 (Login) slice **designed** (no code yet)

- 🧑 **Asked:** Design slice **S6 — Login**, credential-based token issuance. Add
  `POST /login {account_id, secret}` → **200** with a JWT (role pulled from the **stored** account) /
  **401 `invalid_credentials`** — and the 401 must be **identical** for a wrong secret *and* an
  unknown account (no user enumeration). Add bcrypt `password_hash` + `role` columns to `accounts`
  via a timestamped goose migration; seed demo creds `member-123` / `demo-member-pw` and
  `admin-001` / `demo-admin-pw`. Make `secret` **optional** on `POST /accounts` (role always
  `member`; admin only via seed). Enforce **INV-14..17**.
- 🔎 **The one real fork — what happens to the S3 credential-free `POST /token` mint?**
  - ❌ **Rejected: gate `/token` behind a dev-only flag.** Even flagged, it would still let anyone
    self-mint an **admin** token (no credential) whenever the flag is on in CI/dev — that's the exact
    hole S6 exists to close.
  - ✅ **Accepted (user's call): remove `/token` entirely**, every environment. Cleaner security
    story, nothing to misconfigure.
  - **Consequence:** the S3 acceptance `mintToken` helper is rewritten to sign tokens **in-process**
    via the exported `httpapi.IssueToken(acceptanceSecret, ttl, wallet.Identity{...})` (no HTTP mint);
    the two `/token`-specific tests get dropped/repurposed; and the **Schemathesis** recipe in
    `CLAUDE.md` now mints its admin token via `POST /login` with the seeded `admin-001` creds. The
    old `/token`→422 known-non-issue row is removed (the `/login` 401-on-random-creds case is already
    covered by `--exclude-checks positive_data_acceptance`).
- 🤖 **Did (design artifacts only — zero production code):**
  - **OpenAPI:** add `/login` path + `LoginRequest` schema (no `role` field; `secret` `writeOnly`);
    extend `NewAccount` with an optional `writeOnly` `secret`; **delete** the `/token` path +
    `TokenRequest` schema; keep `TokenResponse` + `bearerAuth`.
  - **Data:** new timestamped migration
    `20260619090000_s6_account_credentials.sql` — `ALTER accounts ADD password_hash TEXT` (nullable)
    + `role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member' CHECK(member|admin)`; seed `member-123` + `admin-001` with
    **pre-computed bcrypt (cost 12)** hashes. Mirror the columns into `queries/schema.sql`. New sqlc
    `GetAccountCredential` query; `CreateAccount` query extended with `password_hash`.
  - **Domain:** new sentinel `wallet.ErrInvalidCredentials` (one error for unknown-account /
    NULL-hash / wrong-secret → no enumeration); `WalletService.Login` (bcrypt compare, **dummy
    compare** on the not-found path to flatten timing); `CreateAccount` gains optional secret (bcrypt
    cost 12, pure-Go, lives in the wallet core). Repo interface: `CreateAccount(+passwordHash)`,
    `GetCredential`.
  - **Transport:** new `httpapi/login.go` handler; `CreateAccount` reads the optional secret;
    `publicPaths` swaps `/token` → `/login`; delete the `token.go` HTTP handler (keep the
    package-level `IssueToken` signer).
  - **Issue:** enriched GitHub **issue #10** with the full build-ready design.
- ✅ **Invariants — already registered, no edits:** confirmed `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` already carries
  **INV-14..17** (status ⬜) with the matching test names. Did **not** duplicate them.
- 💡 **Why:** credentials move auth from "trust the request" to "trust the store." Identical 401s +
  a dummy bcrypt compare on the miss path kill **both** enumeration vectors (response shape *and*
  timing). Stored bcrypt-only + `writeOnly` secret means the plaintext never lands in the DB or any
  response.

  `internal/sqlitestore/migrations/20260619090000_s6_account_credentials.sql` (planned) · branch `main`.

### ⏱️ 2026-06-19 · Entry 27 — pre-push hook enforces SOLUTION.md freshness

- 🧑 **Asked:** Add the pre-push hook for true enforcement.
- 🤖 **Did:** Added a version-controlled `.githooks/pre-push` (+ `.githooks/README.md` and a
  `.gitattributes` forcing LF so the `#!/bin/sh` shebang survives a clone) that **blocks** any push
  whose commits change `api/openapi.yaml` or production Go (`internal/**`, `cmd/**`, excluding
  `*_test.go` + `gen/`) without also touching `SOLUTION.md`. Wired it on with
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`; documented the per-clone one-liner in `CLAUDE.md` +
  `.githooks/README.md`.
- ✅ **Verified against real history:** the S5 range (`batch.go` + `openapi.yaml`, no SOLUTION) is
  **blocked** (exit 1, names the files); a SOLUTION-only commit **passes** (exit 0).
- 🔎 **Design choices:** fails **open** if it can't resolve the commit range (a hook bug never wedges
  a push); excludes tests + generated code (they don't change the design narrative); bypass via
  `git push --no-verify` / `SKIP_SOLUTION_CHECK=1` for the rare pure refactor.
- 💡 **Why:** the gate *reminds*, the hook *enforces* — SOLUTION can no longer silently drift behind
  shipped code.
- 🔗 **Artifacts:** .githooks/pre-push · .githooks/README.md · .gitattributes · CLAUDE.md.
